# 🛑 Stop Trying to Sell Me Stuff

Hi there 👋

You're probably reading this because you tried to contact me — via email, LinkedIn, or carrier pigeon — to **sell me something**. Before you take it personally, let me be clear: **this page isn’t meant to be rude**. It’s here because I get an absurd number of unsolicited messages, and honestly, there just aren’t enough hours in the day to respond to everyone with a custom "Thanks, but no thanks."

I appreciate the hustle. I really do. But let’s save us both some time.



## 💼 I'm Not Hiring Your Developers

Yes, Sofascore is a successful company. No, I don't need **your agency's developers**.  
We have a **tight-knit, in-house team** that kicks ass. We’re not looking to outsource.  
If you're offering a "team of vetted senior engineers" — cool, keep them. We’re good.



## 🔧 DevOps Services? No, Thanks

We do our own DevOps. And we do it **very well**. I’ve even spoken at **conferences** about our setup.  
If you’re offering to help us with DevOps, I assure you — **you’re pitching to the wrong crowd**.  
We’re the ones helping others, not the ones needing help.

> 🔍 **Looking for a job?**  
> Awesome. Head over to the [Sofascore Careers page](https://www.sofascore.com/about#careers) and apply like a normal human.  
> Sending cold pitches to my inbox isn’t how we hire people.



## 📦 Selling Your Product? I'm Already All Set

Let me guess — your tool is the best, fastest, most ROI-positive game-changer ever?  
That's great. But no thanks.

- I already use the tools I need.
- I already know which tools solve which problems.
- I stay updated on the tech landscape — **if I wanted your tool, I’d find you.**

Seriously. If your pitch is “Let me show you how we can save you money,” consider that **I’m already saving money by not talking to you**.



## 📊 Dev Management / Monitoring Tools

We have a battle-tested system that works beautifully. It doesn’t need replacing.  
It’s like trying to sell an umbrella to someone standing in a dry room with a roof over their head.



## ☁️ Cloud / VPS / Hosting Offers

Cloud is **too expensive**.  
Yes, even with your discount.  
Yes, even when you include “reduced operational overhead.”  
Yes, even with your magical ROI spreadsheet.

We run on **bare metal**. It’s blazing fast, dirt cheap, and delivers **exceptional performance**.  
We’re one of the fastest live score services out there — we’re not switching to your “next-gen elastic hybrid edge AI platform.” Sorry.



## 🧪 Want Me to Test Your Tool?

No time. Honestly. I don’t care how great it is — **unless someone I trust recommends you**, it’s not happening.

You want feedback or a trial?  
Cool. Compensate me for my time. We’ll talk.



## TL;DR

If your goal is to eventually **take my money**, I’m not interested.  
If your goal is to **give me money**, now we’re talking. 😎



## 🎤 Want Me to Speak at Your Conference?

Now *this* I’m interested in.  
If you’re organizing a conference, meetup, podcast, or anything else where my experience might bring value — **please do reach out**.

Just don’t ask me if I need a Kubernetes monitoring plugin or a team of 12 backend wizards based in “nearshore” locations.  
Thanks in advance ✌️
